  <h3>Peace Corps Prepared to be an Ironman <br> Kendra Goffredo</h3>
    <p>Kendra began preparation for endurance racing during the year she lived along the Indian-Nepalese border in her first Peace Corps assignment. There, among the mosquitoes and</p><p class="hide showthisonclick">rice paddies, and without running water, she survived on grit. She fostered that grit during her second Peace Corps assignment as a health educator in the Ecuadorian Andes. Upon her return to the U.S., Kendra applied that grit to triathlon competition, secured the IRONMAN US Championship amateur title, and raced to a top 10 finish at World Championships in Hawaii. Kendra races triathlon to represent Team Poppy Tony, an endurance project named for her father who has applied an admirable measure of grit in his battle with blood cancer. And that’s where the coolest part of this bio resides: Kendra has used triathlon as a platform to raise over $70,000 for The Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation (The MMRF)</p>
