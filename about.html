<h3>Success in Service: Life after Peace Corps is a student-organized TED-style program in which diverse Returned Peace Corps Volunteers visit college campuses to share fascinating stories about their service and professional accomplishments.</h3>

<section>
  <h4>The goals are to:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Engage attendees in compelling life stories told by yesterday’s Peace Corps Volunteers, today’s leaders.</li>
      <li>Provoke discussion around the merits and challenges of service through storytelling and networking.</li>
      <li>Inspire attendees to see the role that service could play in achieving their own personal and professional aspirations.</li>
</section>

<section>
<h4>Background</h4>
  <p>In April 2014, students in the National Society of Collegiate Scholars (NSCS) at The George Washington University in Washington, DC organized the 1st Success in Service. The event attracted nearly 200 attendees and 9 incredible speakers. Peace Corps gained over 300 leads through Eventbrite registration and recruiters attended the event in person as well.</p>

<section>
<h4>Spring 2016 Internship Program</h4>
  <p>In collaboration with the National Society of Collegiate Scholars, Peace Corps Office of Innovation has recruited over 60 virtual interns who are undergraduates on 50 college campuses around the country. These interns will be responsible for planning and marketing a Success in Service event on their campus sometime between March and May 2016. The Office of Innovation will provide interns with the contact information for their local RPCV group in order to recruit speakers. The Office of Innovation invites recruiters to contact students directly to offer whatever support they deem appropriate, e.g. RPCV speaker suggestions, Peace Corps stickers and pamphlets, offering to table the event, etc.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h4>Strategy</h4>
  <p>The local RPCV group will provide speaker recommendations and the students will organize the event. Each event will be registered on the Peace Corps Eventbrite Brand page, which will allow recruiters to collect contact information for each individual registered at every event. Because the events will be organized by students, they will be able to tap into their own social networks that recruiters may not have accessed before. Videos and photos from each event will be collected by Peace Corps.</p>
